====== Welcome to OFS ======

The OFS (Offline FileSystem or Ohm FileSystem) is a offline-layer which is (or should be) able to extend every filesystem with offline capabilities. This means, that the user is able to work on his network documents, even when he is disconnected from the server. When connecten is restored, the filesystem automatically synchronizes the files.

This project is developed at the [[http://www.ohm-university.eu|Georg Simon Ohm University of Applied Sciences Nuremberg (Germany)]] and is mentored by [[http://www.informatik.fh-nuernberg.de/top.asp?url=http://www.informatik.fh-nuernberg.de/Professors/Trommler/HomeIN.asp|Prof. Dr. Peter Trommler]]. It was inspired by many different projects like Coda, InterMezzo and Windows Offlinefiles and was kicked off by the [[http://da.jonmedia.net|Diploma Theses of Tobias Jähnel]].

The first prototype has been implemented by Frank Gsellmann, [[http://www.jonmedia.net|Tobias Jähnel]] and [[http://www.kolassa.net|Carsten Kolassa]] as a student research project.

====== Linux magazine articles online ======
In January 2009 an article about OFS, written by the original team was issued in the german //Linux Magazin//. It has been translated and came up in the english //Linux Pro Magazine// in February as well.

Now both articles available for reading online.

English: http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Issues/2009/99/CONNECTIONS/

German: http://www.linux-magazin.de/Heft-Abo/Ausgaben/2009/01/Verbindungssuche

The article talks about the idea of OFS, our concepts and ideas. It's worth reading.

====== Current progress ======
The first working prototype has been finished. It is possible to make files from SMB filesystems offline available, reintegrate and there is a rudimentary possibility to detect and solve conflicts manually.

At the moment there is an IT-Project at Georg-Simon-Ohm University running.
