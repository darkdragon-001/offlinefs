====== Extended attributes ======
Interaction with OFS is done using extended attributes. So before you can start, you have to install the tools for using extended attributes, which ship with almost any linux distribution.

OFS supports the following attributes
| ofs.offline | **set** this attribute to make directory and all its subdirectories available offline |
| ofs.available | **remove** this attribute to switch to offline mode |
| |**set** this attribute to switch to online mode|
| |**read** this attribute to see if the share is connected |
| ofs.conflict | **read** this attribute to see if the **given file** or any file in the tree below the **given directory** is in conflicted state |
| |**write** this attribute to choose which file is current. The other one will be overwritten. Possible values: local, remote | 
To make the a path available offline, use the following command
 # setfattr -n ofs.offline /path/to/directory
You can see if a file is currently available by using the command
 # getfattr -n ofs.available /path/to/directory/or/file
