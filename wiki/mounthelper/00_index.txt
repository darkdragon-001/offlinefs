====== Mount helper ======
===== What is a mount helper? =====
The mount helper is a program, located in ///sbin//. It is called //mount.xxx// where xxx is the name of the filesystem. If the mount command is called using //mount -t xxx// it searches for a executable, called ///sbin/mount.xxx// and runs it with the parameters, given to the mount command.

===== OFS mount helper =====
The OFS mount helper mounts the remote share and calls the ofs with the appropriate parameters.

==== Installing the mounthelper ====
  * Copy the //ofsmount// binary from the //mounthelper// directory to ///sbin/mount.ofs//
  * Make sure the ofs binary is called //ofs// and is located somewhere in //PATH//

==== Calling the mounthelper ====
The mounthelper is automatically called by the mount command, when the filesystem ofs is desired. As Device, you give a URL, which contains the remote filesystem as protocol and the share as path.
  # mount -t ofs filesystem://path/to/share /some/local/mountpoint
In order to mount a samba filesystem through OFS, you use (only as root of course) the command:
  # mount -t ofs smb://fileserver/share /some/local/mountpoint
