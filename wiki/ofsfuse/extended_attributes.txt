===== OFS extended attributes =====
The filesystem can be managed from the command line using extended attributes. There are two attributes available at the moment.

==== ofs.offline ====
Indicated whether the directory or file is marked //offline//. If you set the attribute on a directory, the subtree, starting with this directory is copied to the offline cache. If you remove it, the offline cache for this tree is cleaned.

**Note:** You can remove the ''ofs.offline'' attribute only on the root of an offline tree.
==== ofs.available ====
This attribute indicates whether there is a connection to the network share, this file or directory is in.

===== Using extended attributes =====
Make sure the package //attr// is installed.

==== Get extended attribute ====
  # getfattr -n <attribute name> <path>
==== Set exteded attribute ====
  # setfattr -n <attribute name> <path>
or
  # setfattr -n <attribute name> -v <value> <path>
==== Remove exteded attribute ==== 
  # setfattr -x <attribute name> <path>
**Note:** The attributes //ofs.available// and //ofs.offline// are always available and contain one of the values 'yes' or 'no'. Even if you remove //ofs.offline// it does not disappear but switches to 'no'. Should we change this??
==== List extended attributes ====
  # getfattr -d <path>
**Note:** This does not list our OFS attributes, because attributes of a FUSE filesystem are only shown if they are in the namespace //user// (i.e. name starts with //user.//). This might be a bug in FUSE.
